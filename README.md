## Python_API_Calling
Various small APIs projects based on Python  

## What is an API?

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a server that you can use to retrieve and send data to using code. APIs are most commonly used to retrieve data, and that will be the focus of this beginner tutorial.

When we want to receive data from an API, we need to make a request. Requests are used all over the web. For instance, when you visited this blog post, your web browser made a request to the Dataquest web server, which responded with the content of this web page. 


## Making API Requests in Python

In order to work with APIs in Python, we need tools that will make those requests. In Python, the most common library for making requests and working with APIs is the requests library. The requests library isn’t part of the standard Python library, so you’ll need to install it to get started.
```
pip3 install requests
```

### Technologies Used
- Python

## Requirements (Pythons's libraries)
1. Requests (For making APIs request)


## Visual Studio Code SetUp
1. Clone the repository-> cd into the cloned repository folder
2. Create a python virtual environment in each respective project folder.

```
# macOS/Linux
# You may need to run sudo apt-get install python3-venv first
python3 -m venv .venv

# Windows
# You can also use py -3 -m venv .venv
python -m venv .venv
```
When you create a new virtual environment, a prompt will be displayed to allow you to select it for the workspace.

3. Activate the virtual environment

```
#linux
source ./venv/bin/activate  # sh, bash, or zsh

#windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
